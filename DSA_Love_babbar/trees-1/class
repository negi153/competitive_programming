class 2 1:00
class -->
balance tree
or convert tree into sum tree
lowest common ancestor --> most important
kth ancestor --> 1 option (by traversing)  , 2 option -> store in vector and find
find path in tree which gives fixed sum

homework --> 
kth ancestor by vector
is tree sum tree 
find all the path between any 2 nodes which gives sum equal to fixed value
