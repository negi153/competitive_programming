Homework
    1. inorder/preorder/postorder --> iterative method
    2. create tree using level order traversla
    3. check if 2 tree are identical
    4.check if 2 trees are mirror images

class 2 1:00
class -->
balance tree
or convert tree into sum tree
lowest common ancestor --> most important
kth ancestor --> 1 option (by traversing)  , 2 option -> store in vector and find
find path in tree which gives fixed sum

homework --> 
kth ancestor by vector
is tree sum tree 
find all the path between any 2 nodes which gives sum equal to fixed value
sum of longest bloodline in binary tree
