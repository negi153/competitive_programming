Q1. merge k sorted arrays
    logic 1 - move all elements in 1 aray and sort --> nk log(nk)

    logic 2- crete min heap and store first element of all the k sorted array in min heap. heap size will be k.
            the top of the  heap will be smallest so put that eleent in final_array and pop that and push next element of that array into heap.

Q2. merge k sorted linkedlist -> 
    leetcode -> https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/
    
    same as above

Q3. amazon level question --> smallest range in k sorted linkedlist?
    leetcode hard - https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-covering-elements-from-k-lists/
    
    logic 1 - if we consider first element of k arrays, so maximum and minimum among those will include atleast 1 element from each sorted linkedlist. go next of min element so decrease the range

    NOTE --> code is not correct giving issue -> need to see video again
