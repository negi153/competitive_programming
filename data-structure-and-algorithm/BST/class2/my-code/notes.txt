BST property -> 
    1. left < root > rights
    2. inorder is sorted

Question
1. validate BST
    sol 1-> store inorder in a vector ->if it is sorted, then it is BST otherwise not -> o(n)
    sol 2-> by recursion

2. LCA (lowest common ancestor)


Q3. kth smallest

Q4. create bst from inorder

Q5. convert BST to balanced BSt -> get inorder and cret BST again

Q6. find nodes whose sum is target
    method 1 - > traverse on each node --> then for each node find the target - node from tree 
    method 2 -> inorder -> 2 pointer approach
