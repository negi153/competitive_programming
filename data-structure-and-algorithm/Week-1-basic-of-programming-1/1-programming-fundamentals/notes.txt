flow chart -> algorithm ko graphical form m dikhana ( to show algorithm in a graphical form)
algorithm -> series of steps to complete a task. 
    eg. making tea steps -> 
    1. take water 
    2. put on pan
    3. open gas
    4. put tea
    5. put sugar
    6. put milk

pseudo code -> nakli code (fake code) --> which computer doesn't understand but humans can understand
            - generic way of representing your algo in textual format. (normal english languaage)
            eg. 
            1. start program
            2. enter 2 number A & B
            3. add the numbers
            4. print sum
            5. end program

Today we  learned about : 
1. Thought process to solve a problem.
2. Algorithm.
3. Flowchat.
4. Pseudocode. 

So thought process to solve a problem involves understanding the problem, knowing about the input values and then coming up with a approach to solve it. 

Algorithm: It can be defined as set of steps required to complete a task.

Flowchart: is a graphical representation of an algorithm. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information & processing. 

A flow chart has following components: 
1. Terminator 
2. Input /Output 
3. Process Block
4. Decision Making Block 
5. Arrows 
6. Connector

Pseudocode: Nakli Code 
It is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do in textual form.
