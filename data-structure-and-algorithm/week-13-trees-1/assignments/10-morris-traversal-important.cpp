// Inorder traversal -> 
    // time complexity - o(n)
    // space complexity - o(n) (recursion stack)

    // Goal of morris traversal -> we need to do the inorder traversal but we want to keep space complexity as o(1)

    // Moris traversl - it is a inorder traversal where time complexity - o(n), but space complexity - o(1)
