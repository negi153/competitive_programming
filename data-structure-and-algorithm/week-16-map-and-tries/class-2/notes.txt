tries - a type of Data Structure
        1. multi way tree structure (means a node can have many childern)
        2. majorly used for pattern searching. 
        3. time complexity proportional to pattern length (approx)
        4. used for large amount of Data
        5. google auto suggestion can be created by this Data structure,[ we can also create a project on this.]

    * store null character (\0) in root
    * for last character of stirng, store extra data so we can identify that this is last node of string. it is terminal node of string

    * when we need to delete a string, don't delete all the character because it will impact other strings, just mark last character of string as "not terminal"

    --> Insertion -> o(n)  --> length of word
                if node present -> go to the node
                if node is absent -> create node and go to node


        children can be stored in map as well

    --> search -->o(n) --> length of word


Q1. tree creation, insrtion, searching, deletion
