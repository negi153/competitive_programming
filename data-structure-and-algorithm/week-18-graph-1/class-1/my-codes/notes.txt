Graph - a type of datastructure which is the combination of nodes and edges.
    node or vertex - to store data
    edtes - to connect nodes

why need graph?
    - google map
    - facebook

Types of graph - 
    1. directed graph -> edge has arrow (uni-directional)
    2. undirected graph -> edge doesn't have arrow (bi-directional)

weighted graph -> if edge has weight, then it is called weighted graph
    1. wieghted directed graph - graph has directed edges and has weight
    2. weighted undirected graph - graph has undirected edges and has weight

if weight is not mentioed in graph, and we need weight to process graph, then assume it as 1

Degree - 
    in case of =  
    undirected  graph -> no. of edges connected with node is called degree of node
