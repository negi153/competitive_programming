Q1 - why pointer size if 8 byte in 64 bit system and 4 bytes in 32 bits system always?
    eg . 
    int a=5;
    int* p=&a;
    cout<<sizeof(p)<<endl; // 8

    or 

    double b=5.5;
    double* q =&b;
    cout<<sizeof(q)<<endl; // 8
    
ans - > a pointer (variable which points to a memory location) should be able to point to any of the memory address 
( 2^32 for 32 bit and 2^64 for 64 bit ) that a machines holds. Because of this reason we see the size of a pointer 
to be 4 bytes in 32 bit machine and 8 bytes in a 64 bit machine.
